# Screen Ambience
This application can be used for various RGBlight effects from reading the primary screen.

A basic level of HUE and HUE Entertainment groups are supported. RGB keyboards/mice from Corsair/Logitech/Razer are supported although only Corsair has been tested. More devices may be supported in future.

If you are building the project yourself you will have to include the RGB.net dlls yourself or add them from nuget as I use my own build for device support.

If you are on a system with a integrated gpu using the Microsoft Hybrid system. Make sure application is set to use the integrated gpu. And adapter will probably need to be set to 0.
